## Conferences
### [dotCSS 2015](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMW8Xq7bXrG5kujoYQdw94ip3cnV4WR59)
- [Rachel Andrew - The New CSS Layout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVk7xMrcEMk)
  [(view the slides)](http://www.slideshare.net/rachelandrew/the-new-css-layout-dotcss)
> We are in the middle of the biggest change in how we lay out webpages since we switched from tables to CSS. Rachel explains how Flexbox, CSS Grid Layout and the Box Alignment Model work together to create a new system for layout.

- [Chris Eppstein - The expanding boundaries of CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3yhR14a83U)
  [(view the slides)](http://www.slideshare.net/chriseppstein/the-expanding-boundaries-of-css)
> CSS was designed with boundaries in place to make it simple and accessible to “non-programmers”. Those boundaries have benefits as well as drawbacks that affect us in technical and non-technical ways. Recent developments in web tooling and technologies are expanding the boundaries of CSS -- hopefully for the better.

- [Una Kravets - Editing Images in CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BquKccQReM)
> CSS is a surprisingly powerful image manipulation tool. Una explores three CSS features: filters, blend modes, and gradients both individually and in combination to create great image effects.

- [Alan Stearns - Becoming Responsible for CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ggNcqdwT-Y)
  [(view the slides)](http://slides.com/alanstearns/deck#/)
> Alan tells us how to help the CSS Working Group create the future of CSS: speak up about your own work, shout when things go wrong, and help us script our way to better CSS.

- [Tom Giannattasio - Transform Alchemy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KLX9a9p-Tk)
  [(view the slides)](http://attasi.com/transforms/)
> The transform is one of the most powerful CSS properties, but also one of the most abused. Tom helps us wield its power to create simple, fast and engaging work.

### [dotJS 2015](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMW8Xq7bXrG70G62mxQR0OC4GkUcNLRnC)

- [Tim Caswell - Teaching Kids Programming using Web Browsers and Real Robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6BEMQNyiRY)
  [(view the slides)](https://gist.github.com/creationix/507719a418be365c7631)
> Watch Tim's son livecode real hardware robots over wifi using JavaScript compilers in the browser, C VMs on micontrollers, and a Lua server as relay system. Then dive into the tech.

- [Andre Medeiros - The whole future declared in a var](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfZpr0USIi4)
  [(view the slides)](https://speakerdeck.com/staltz/the-whole-future-declared-in-a-var)
> Andre explores reactive programming, a paradigm centered on one idea: specifying the dynamic behavior of a variable only at the declaration of that variable. The benefits of this approach are the use of declarative programming and a better separation of concerns.

- [Rebecca Murphey - HTTP/2 is here, now let's make it easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KmR-JD3dGo)
  [(view the slides)](https://speakerdeck.com/rmurphey/2-is-here-now-lets-make-it-easy)
> The HTTP/2 spec was finalized in 2015, and developers are hearing calls to start optimizing for the new protocol. Rebecca argues HTTP/2 isn't complete without a developer ecosystem to support it.

- [Henrik Joreteg - Pocket-sized JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okk0BGV9oY0)
  [(view the slides)](https://slides.joreteg.com/dotjs/)
> JavaScript on the mobile web has a bad rap as being slow and non-performant. Henrik argues that by being minimalist from the start and using new techniques like Virtual DOM and Web Workers, we can do more with less and build blazing fast apps on mobile.

- [Forbes Lindesay - The Compiler Pipeline of Pug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr-Sqz3jAKg) 
  [(view the slides)](http://www.slideshare.net/ForbesLindesay/pug-a-compiler-pipeline?ref=http://www.thedotpost.com/2015/12/forbes-lindesay-pug-the-compiler-pipeline)
> From Lexer to Code-Gen, Forbes takes us on a deep dive of the compiler pipeline of the templating language Pug (formerly Jade).
